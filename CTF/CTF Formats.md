# 🧩 CTF Formats Overview

Moving forward, let’s explore some **CTF formats** you might encounter in the cybersecurity field.

## ⚔️ Attack-Defense (AD)

Imagine a **digital battlefield**.  
Each competing team receives an identical virtual machine **riddled with vulnerabilities** — like cracks in armor waiting to be exploited.  

Your mission:  
- **Attack** other teams by exploiting their machine’s weaknesses to access hidden services and capture flags.  
- **Defend** your own machine by patching vulnerabilities and securing services to prevent flag theft.  

Success requires a balance between **offense** and **defense** — the best teams excel at both.

## 🧠 Jeopardy

You’ll face a set of cybersecurity challenges in categories such as:

- Miscellaneous trivia  

Each solved challenge yields a **flag** and **points**.  
The more challenges you complete, the higher your ranking climbs.
