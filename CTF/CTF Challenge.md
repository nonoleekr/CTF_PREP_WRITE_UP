## ðŸ’¡ Bonus Intel

Keep your eyes peeled â€” some challenges (like those from **Siber Siaga CTF 2023** and **rawSEC rENTAS CTF 2024**) may also include **Submission Limits** and **Attachments**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Submission Limits
Some challenges restrict how many times a team or participant can attempt to submit a flag.  
Think of it as **limited ammo** â€” use your shots wisely!

### ðŸ“Ž Attachments
Certain challenges come with attachments â€” they could be **images, audio, or videos**.  
These files are crucial to solving the challenge, but players often **overlook them** and waste time. Stay alert and inspect everything!

They look something like this:
