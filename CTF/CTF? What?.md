## 🎮 What Are CTFs?

**CTFs (Capture The Flag)** are thrilling cybersecurity competitions where participants go head-to-head, cracking cryptographic algorithms, exploiting hidden vulnerabilities, and uncovering secrets buried in digital artifacts.  

Think of them as **digital scavenger hunts** — but instead of running around, you’ll be solving a wide range of **cybersecurity-themed challenges**.

## 🧩 How It Works

Each CTF challenge is like a **puzzle** you must solve to **capture a hidden flag**.  
Flags are secret codes that usually look like this:

Once you find a flag:
1. **Submit** it on the CTF platform (like **CTFPrep**).  
2. **Earn points** for every correct flag.  
3. Compete to reach the **top of the leaderboard** and claim the **CTF champion’s crown!**
