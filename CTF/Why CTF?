Find out the total prize pool in RM for the International Battle of Hackers (IBOH) 2024 (sum up all categories). Wrap your answer in the CTFPrep flag format (Example: CTFPrep{RM9999.00}).  
Hint: Just search for relevant posts on APU's Forensics & Cyber Security Research Center - Student Section (FSeC-SS) social media accounts (Instagram/LinkedIn). There are posts on BOH prize pools, and they're also printed on the mock cheques.
